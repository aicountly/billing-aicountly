# What Billing needs from other products

Billing owns no accounting data. Every figure on every screen is read live from
the product that owns it, on the request that draws it — so this file is the
complete list of what Billing asks for, and of the three things it asks for that
nobody serves yet.

The rule this file exists to keep honest: **when a capability is missing, the
screen says so.** It does not fall back to a stored copy, and it does not render
the absence as a zero.

## Who owns what

| Question | Owner | How Billing gets it |
|---|---|---|
| Who is signed in? | **MY** (portal) | `Authorization: Bearer <ses_key>`, validated at my.aicountly.com |
| Which company, branch, financial year? | **Manage** | `v1/manage/companies`, `v1/manage/companyinfo`, live |
| What did I sell, and to whom? | **Smart Books** | `registers?vch_type_id=…`, live |
| Who owes me, whom do I owe? | **Smart Books** | `reports/bill-by-bill`, live, aged in Billing |
| How much cash and bank? | **Smart Books** | `reports/account-summary`, live |
| What is this party's ledger? | **Smart Books** | `reports/account-ledger`, live |
| What is the tax on this bill? | **Smart Books** | computed there; Billing sends no tax fields |
| Is this item in stock? | **Inventory** | `InventoryClient`, live |
| What did this item cost? | **Inventory** | live, and stripped for anyone without `cost.view` |
| Who may do what *inside Billing*? | **Billing** | its own `billing_profiles` |

### Manage

`GET companies`, `GET companyinfo` — the company, branch and financial-year
switcher. Read on the request that draws it; the three ids are all Billing keeps.

## Not available: bank statement matching

**Dashboard 5 shows an unavailable state for this, with this file named on it.**

Billing has no bank feed and no statement import, and bank reconciliation is not
a billing front-end's job — it belongs to the accounts. Two cards and one panel
depend on a contract that does not exist yet:

* the **Unmatched bank entries** metric
* the **Suggested bank matches** panel
* the **Bank entries matched** step of the day-close checklist

### The contract Billing would need

Owner: **Smart Books**.

```
GET reports/bank-reconciliation/unmatched
  ?cmp_id&fy_id&bo_id&account_id&from&to&limit&offset

  → { data: [ {
        statement_line_id, account_id, value_date, narration,
        reference_no, direction: "credit"|"debit", amount, currency
      } ], meta: { total, limit, offset } }

GET reports/bank-reconciliation/candidates
  ?cmp_id&fy_id&statement_line_id&limit

  → { data: [ {
        voucher_id, voucher_uuid, voucher_no, voucher_date,
        account_id, account_name, amount,
        match_evidence: { amount_exact: bool, date_within_days: int,
                          reference_matches: bool }
      } ] }

POST reports/bank-reconciliation/confirm
  Idempotency-Key: <billing key>
  { cmp_id, fy_id, statement_line_id, voucher_ids: [ … ] }
  → { data: { statement_line_id, status: "MATCHED", matched_voucher_ids: [ … ] } }
```

Authentication: the caller's `Authorization: Bearer <ses_key>`, so Books applies
that user's own permissions. Billing additionally requires `bank.view` before it
will call any of them.

`match_evidence` is required rather than a score: the panel explains *why* two
records look like the same one, and a bare confidence number cannot be checked
by the person confirming it.

**Until this exists**, the metric renders as Unavailable with the reason, the
panel explains the missing capability, and the checklist step says so rather
than pretending there is nothing to match.

## Not available: supplier-bill extraction

**Dashboard 4 shows an unavailable state for this.**

Reading a bill out of a PDF or a photo needs a document-extraction service, and
this deployment has none. Billing does not add an OCR stack, and it does not ask
a model to guess at a supplier's totals.

Enabled by setting `DOCUMENT_EXTRACTION_BASE` in `server-php/.env` once a
service exists. Money received offers the same capability as **Scan receipt**,
disabled for the same reason and behind the same flag. The expected shape,
following the house "deterministic first, AI only for what is left" rule:

```
POST <DOCUMENT_EXTRACTION_BASE>/v1/extract
  multipart: file=<pdf|jpg|png>, hint=supplier_bill
  → { data: {
        fields: { supplier_name, supplier_gstin, bill_no, bill_date,
                  total_amount, tax_amount, currency },
        confidence_by_field: { <field>: "high"|"low" },
        lines: [ { description, hsn_sac, qty, rate, amount } ],
        page_images: [ <url> ]
      } }
```

Every extracted field must arrive reviewable, and nothing is posted until a
person has approved it. **Until this exists**, the panel offers the manual path,
which records exactly the same purchase bill.

## Not available: payment-proof attachments

**Money received shows an unavailable state for this, on the screen itself.**

A receipt is often backed by something — a UPI screenshot, a photographed
counterfoil, a bank advice — and the person entering it would like to keep the
proof beside the entry. Billing cannot: there is no document store in this
deployment, and the receipt payload Books accepts carries no attachment
reference, so a file chosen on that screen would have nowhere to be filed. The
screen therefore draws the section and says so, rather than accepting a file and
losing it.

### The contract Billing would need

Owner: **Vault**, or whichever product holds documents in the deployment.

```
POST <DOCUMENT_STORE_BASE>/v1/documents
  multipart: file=<pdf|jpg|png>, cmp_id, kind=payment_proof
  → { data: { document_id, document_uuid, filename, bytes, content_type, url } }

DELETE <DOCUMENT_STORE_BASE>/v1/documents/{id}
```

And, from **Smart Books**, one field on the receipt voucher — an array of
document uuids — so the proof travels with the entry rather than being findable
only from this product.

Until both exist, the entry screen records the receipt without a proof, which is
what the previous screen did too. `web/src/pages/money-received/features.ts` is
where it is turned on.

## Not depended on: Aicountly Pay

Nothing in this product requires a payment gateway, and nothing in it moves
money. "Record receipt" and "Record payment" write an accounting voucher in
Smart Books against a cash or bank ledger — that is a record of something that
happened, not an instruction to a bank.

There is no `Pay now` button, no payment link, no webhook listener and no
settlement state. When Aicountly Pay is configured, it arrives as an adapter
beside the existing methods; no screen in this product has been shaped around
its absence, so none has to be reshaped by its arrival.
